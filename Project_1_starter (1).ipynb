    "# Project 1 Starter\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is draft - version 0 - changes are possible and will be anounced.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Project 1 is to allow students to practice Data Science concepts learned so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will include following tasks:\n",
    "- Load dataset. Don't use \"index\" column for training.\n",
    "- Clean up the data:\n",
    "    - Encode replace missing values\n",
    "    - Replace features values that appear incorrect\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables\n",
    "- Split dataset to Train/Validation/Test\n",
    "- Add engineered features\n",
    "- Train and tune ML model\n",
    "- Provide final metrics using Test dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of models to train\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final submission should include single model. \n",
    "The model set you should try to come up with best model:\n",
    "1. Sklearn Logistic Regression - try all combinations of regularization\n",
    "2. H2O-3 GLM - try different combinations of regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "You should train/fit categorical features scalers and encoders on Train only. Use `transform` or equivalent function on Validation/Test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand all the steps before model training, so that you can reliably replicate and test them to produce scoring function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You should generate various new features. Examples of such features can be seen in the Module-3 lecture on GLMs.\n",
    "Your final model should have at least **10** new engineered features. On-hot-encoding, label encoding, and target encoding is not included in the **10** features.\n",
    "You can try, but target encoding is not expected to produce improvement for Linear models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas for Feature engineering for various types of variables:\n",
    "1. https://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/1-10-lts/docs/userguide/transformations.html\n",
    "2. GLM lecture and hands-on (Module-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: \n",
    "- You don't have to perform feature engineering using H2O-3 even if you decided to use H2O-3 GLM for model training.\n",
    "- It is OK to perfor feature engineering using any technique, as long as you can replicate it correctly in the Scoring function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threshold calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to calculate optimal threshold for class assignment using F1 metric:\n",
    "- If using sklearn, use F1 `macro`: `f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='macro')` \n",
    "- If using H2O-3, use F1\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to find optimal probability threshold for class assignment, the threshold that maximizes above F1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scoring function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Project-1 will be graded based on the completeness and performance of your final model against the hold-out dataset.\n",
    "The hold-out dataset will not be known to the students. As part of your deliverables, you will need to submit a scoring function. The scoring function will perform the following:\n",
    "- Accept dataset in the same format as provided with the project, minus \"MIS_Status\" column\n",
    "- Load trained model and any encoders/scalers that are needed to transform data\n",
    "- Transform dataset into format that can be scored with the trained model\n",
    "- Score the dataset and return the results, for each record\n",
    "    - Record ID\n",
    "    - Record label as determined by final model (0 or 1)\n",
    "    - If your model returns probabilities, you need to assign the label based on maximum F1 threshold\n",
    "    \n",
    "Scoring function header:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def project_1_scoring(data):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Function to score input dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Input: dataset in Pandas DataFrame format\n",
    "    Output: Python list of labels in the same order as input records\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Flow:\n",
    "        - Load artifacts\n",
    "        - Transform dataset\n",
    "        - Score dataset\n",
    "        - Return labels\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    l = data.shape[0]\n",
    "    return l*[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for full example of scoring function at the bottom of the notebook. **Don't copy as is - this is just an example**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables in a single zip file in the following structure:\n",
    "- `notebook` (folder)\n",
    "    - Jupyter notebook with complete code to manipulate data, train and tune final model. `ipynb` format\n",
    "    - Jupyter notebook in `html` format\n",
    "- `artifacts` (folder)\n",
    "    - Model and any potential encoders in the \"pkl\" format or native H2O-3 format (for H2O-3 model)\n",
    "    - Scoring function that will load the final model and encoders. Separate from above notebook or `.py` file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook should include explanations about your code and be designed to be easily followed and results replicated. Once you are done with the final version, you will need to test it by running all cells from top to bottom after restarting Kernel. It can be done by running `Kernel -> Restart & Run All`\n",
    "\n",

    "## Dataset description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) The U.S. SBA was founded in 1953 on the principle of promoting and assisting small enterprises in the U.S. credit market (SBA Overview and History, US Small Business Administration (2015)). Small businesses have been a primary source of job creation in the United States; therefore, fostering small business formation and growth has social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment. There have been many success stories of start-ups receiving SBA loan guarantees such as FedEx and Apple Computer. However, there have also been stories of small businesses and/or start-ups that have defaulted on their SBA-guaranteed loans.  \n",
